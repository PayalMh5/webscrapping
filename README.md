# Webscrapping
Scrape and analyze data analyst job requirements with Python.

# Summary

Scraped job postings using Python, BeautifulSoup, and CSV handling: HTTP requests, HTML parsing, job data extraction.

# Solution

The solution utilized Python to send HTTP requests to job listing websites, parsed HTML content using BeautifulSoup, and extracted job details. Data was then stored in CSV format, achieving comprehensive job data extraction and storage for analysis.


# Approach

I started by importing necessary libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, and csv. Then, I defined a function to generate job search URLs dynamically based on user inputs. Using requests, I sent HTTP GET requests to retrieve HTML content from the URLs. BeautifulSoup parsed the HTML to locate job postings, and another function extracted job details. Finally, I stored the data in a CSV file, ensuring the project achieved seamless job data extraction and organization.
